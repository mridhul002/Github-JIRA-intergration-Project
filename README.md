# Github-JIRA-intergration-Project
This repo helps you to automation for create story in Jira when a issue in github

DESCRIPTION:
This project automates the process of creating a JIRA story whenever a specific command (/jira) is posted in a GitHub issue comment. It uses a Flask-based webhook receiver that listens for GitHub issue events, processes the comment body, and triggers JIRA's REST API to create a new story in the specified project. The integration eliminates the need for manual task creation in JIRA, ensuring faster workflow automation and improved collaboration between development and project management teams

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Flask Server
python app.py
Your Flask server will run on port 5000 and listen for GitHub events.

üìå How It Works
GitHub sends an issue comment event to your Flask endpoint.

The script extracts the comment body.

If the body contains /jira, it sends a POST request to the JIRA API with the predefined payload.

A new JIRA story is created automatically.
